The sea can be quiet, but many know that winds and waves can vary.
I sometimes find myself drowning in things. I most certainly need a thinking tool.

It's good to have a boat to navigate the sea. But it's better to have a map and compass.

The concept of finding potential solutions to a problem. 
It is different then the other way around.
Find things.

### What constitute an idea?

- It is a group, a pathway, often referred to a train of thoughts which put together connect two things and eventually forms something.
- It is a (new) connection between two thoughts, or groups of thoughts.
- An idea can grow to a cluster.

### Why do we need ideas?

- Because we have problems.

In example, I experience trouble to focus on one thing.

The more I search, the more or less I find.

### How do ideas form?

Ideation on complex, non-linear, problems leads to complex, non-linear concepts.
Ideation on complex, non-linear, problems requires non-linear thinking and often leads to complex, non-linear problems. 

Syntropy: A problem or solution that grow in complexity (an increasing number of moving/separate parts).

Entropy: Reducing the complexity of a problem or solution.
