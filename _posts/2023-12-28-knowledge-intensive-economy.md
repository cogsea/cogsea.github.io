A knowledge-intensive economy refers to an economic system that largely relies on the [production, dissemination, and utilization of knowledge](/knowledge-management/) and information as the main driver of growth and development. In this type of economy, the use of advanced technology, innovation, and intellectual capital becomes crucial for economic progress.

In a knowledge-intensive economy, the primary focus is on industries and sectors that heavily rely on research and development, scientific expertise, and higher education. These sectors can include technology, software development, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, telecommunications, finance, and other knowledge-based services.

The knowledge-intensive economy often requires a highly skilled and educated workforce, as it relies on individuals with specialized knowledge, advanced technical skills, and the ability to apply them creatively. This can lead to a higher demand for professionals, researchers, engineers, scientists, and other knowledge workers.

Knowledge-intensive economies are often associated with high productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. They are driven by continuous learning, research, and development to create new products, services, and processes. Governments and organizations in these economies often invest heavily in education, research institutions, infrastructure, and supportive policies to foster a climate of knowledge creation and utilization.

Overall, a knowledge-intensive economy relies on the [effective management and application of knowledge](/effective-knowledge-management/) to drive economic growth, generate wealth, and enhance overall societal well-being.
