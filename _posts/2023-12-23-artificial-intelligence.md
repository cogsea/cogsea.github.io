Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, learn, and solve problems like humans. 

It involves creating intelligent algorithms that enable computers and machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, visual perception, decision-making, problem-solving, and learning. 

AI aims to replicate human cognitive abilities and enhance efficiency, accuracy, and automation in various domains and industries.
