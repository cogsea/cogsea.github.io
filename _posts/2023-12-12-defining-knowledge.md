In the context of information systems and AI, knowledge is best defined to us as **access to information**, or the **procedure of its retrieval**, rather than its storage.

In that context, the storage of information is referred to as a *knowledge base*.

Knowledge can be defined in many ways. In a scientific way such as above, or in a common way.

In the context of society or relatively large organizations, the access to information is granted by systems and people. Indeed, if we cannot find information within a system, we'll tend to search it within our direct entourage, meaning the people around us.
