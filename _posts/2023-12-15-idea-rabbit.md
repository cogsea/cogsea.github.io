After graduating

I started working as a junior data analyst in a small knowledge based organization of about 10 full time employees. 

I quickly turned into a "digital expert", although far from being an expert, yet having automated the most annoying parts of my work.

During my first job, even if I was not automating the cool things: reading, discovering and understanding new things. 

I would often fell on my chair plain bored as automating my work did not make it more interesting.
%% or maybe it showed me what I truly enjoy doing: imagining and creating stuff. %%

Welcome to the digital world.
