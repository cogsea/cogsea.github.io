The tunnels taken by the rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, or idea rabbit.

## Research and Knowledge

When I do research on a project, or simply read online, I often find new things, ideas or project to read and maybe develop. 

I often digress from the original idea, project or research.

<!-- Which leads me to think there is a something common behind every project. Maybe an exit from the rabbit hole.-->

It's a wicked labyrinth of dark paths where the only light shall come from the rabbit itself, through learning and knowledge.

## Learning and Knowledge

It seems to be that the more you learn, the less you know.

> <span class="spoiler"> The more you learn, the more you realize the less you know. You think you’re approaching some kind of horizon, but in fact the horizon is receding, and the more you learn, the more you see that horizon is very far away. Life would be pretty boring if we understood everything so better that we don't understand everything </span><cite>— Noam Chomsky</cite> 

And through the rabbit hole goes the idea rabbit.
